# WIP - Sombra

![Sombra](https://i.imgur.com/QQnxGfW.jpg)

This is a game for [GitHub Game Off 2016](https://github.com/blog/2274-game-off-theme-announcement)
a game jam with the theme Hacking, Modding or Augmenting.

I have no idea if it will end up with any references to Sombra, but since this new Overwatch character
was just recently announced and totally fits into the "Hacking" category, I decided to use Sombra as working title.
